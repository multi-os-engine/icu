/**
 * {@icuenhanced java.lang.Character}.{@icu _usage_}
 *
 * <p>The UCharacter class provides extensions to the {@link java.lang.Character} class.
 * These extensions provide support for more Unicode properties.
 * Each ICU release supports the latest version of Unicode available at that time.
 *
 * <p>For some time before Java 5 added support for supplementary Unicode code points,
 * The ICU UCharacter class and many other ICU classes already supported them.
 * Some UCharacter methods and constants were widened slightly differently than
 * how the Character class methods and constants were widened later.
 * In particular, {@link Character#MAX_VALUE} is still a char with the value U+FFFF,
 * while the {@link UCharacter#MAX_VALUE} is an int with the value U+10FFFF.
 *
 * <p>Code points are represented in these API using ints. While it would be
 * more convenient in Java to have a separate primitive datatype for them,
 * ints suffice in the meantime.
 *
 * <p>Aside from the additions for UTF-16 support, and the updated Unicode
 * properties, the main differences between UCharacter and Character are:
 * <ul>
 * <li> UCharacter is not designed to be a char wrapper and does not have
 *      APIs to which involves management of that single char.<br>
 *      These include:
 *      <ul>
 *        <li> char charValue(),
 *        <li> int compareTo(java.lang.Character, java.lang.Character), etc.
 *      </ul>
 * <li> UCharacter does not include Character APIs that are deprecated, nor
 *      does it include the Java-specific character information, such as
 *      boolean isJavaIdentifierPart(char ch).
 * <li> Character maps characters 'A' - 'Z' and 'a' - 'z' to the numeric
 *      values '10' - '35'. UCharacter also does this in digit and
 *      getNumericValue, to adhere to the java semantics of these
 *      methods.  New methods unicodeDigit, and
 *      getUnicodeNumericValue do not treat the above code points
 *      as having numeric values.  This is a semantic change from ICU4J 1.3.1.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * In addition to Java compatibility functions, which calculate derived properties,
 * this API provides low-level access to the Unicode Character Database.
 * <p>
 * Unicode assigns each code point (not just assigned character) values for
 * many properties.
 * Most of them are simple boolean flags, or constants from a small enumerated list.
 * For some properties, values are strings or other relatively more complex types.
 * <p>
 * For more information see
 * <a href="http://www.unicode/org/ucd/">"About the Unicode Character Database"</a>
 * (http://www.unicode.org/ucd/)
 * and the <a href="http://www.icu-project.org/userguide/properties.html">ICU
 * User Guide chapter on Properties</a>
 * (http://www.icu-project.org/userguide/properties.html).
 * <p>
 * There are also functions that provide easy migration from C/POSIX functions
 * like isblank(). Their use is generally discouraged because the C/POSIX
 * standards do not define their semantics beyond the ASCII range, which means
 * that different implementations exhibit very different behavior.
 * Instead, Unicode properties should be used directly.
 * <p>
 * There are also only a few, broad C/POSIX character classes, and they tend
 * to be used for conflicting purposes. For example, the "isalpha()" class
 * is sometimes used to determine word boundaries, while a more sophisticated
 * approach would at least distinguish initial letters from continuation
 * characters (the latter including combining marks).
 * (In ICU, BreakIterator is the most sophisticated API for word boundaries.)
 * Another example: There is no "istitle()" class for titlecase characters.
 * <p>
 * ICU 3.4 and later provides API access for all twelve C/POSIX character classes.
 * ICU implements them according to the Standard Recommendations in
 * Annex C: Compatibility Properties of UTS #18 Unicode Regular Expressions
 * (http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr18/#Compatibility_Properties).
 * <p>
 * API access for C/POSIX character classes is as follows:
 * <pre>{@code
 * - alpha:     isUAlphabetic(c) or hasBinaryProperty(c, UProperty.ALPHABETIC)
 * - lower:     isULowercase(c) or hasBinaryProperty(c, UProperty.LOWERCASE)
 * - upper:     isUUppercase(c) or hasBinaryProperty(c, UProperty.UPPERCASE)
 * - punct:     ((1<<getType(c)) & ((1<<DASH_PUNCTUATION)|(1<<START_PUNCTUATION)|
 *               (1<<END_PUNCTUATION)|(1<<CONNECTOR_PUNCTUATION)|(1<<OTHER_PUNCTUATION)|
 *               (1<<INITIAL_PUNCTUATION)|(1<<FINAL_PUNCTUATION)))!=0
 * - digit:     isDigit(c) or getType(c)==DECIMAL_DIGIT_NUMBER
 * - xdigit:    hasBinaryProperty(c, UProperty.POSIX_XDIGIT)
 * - alnum:     hasBinaryProperty(c, UProperty.POSIX_ALNUM)
 * - space:     isUWhiteSpace(c) or hasBinaryProperty(c, UProperty.WHITE_SPACE)
 * - blank:     hasBinaryProperty(c, UProperty.POSIX_BLANK)
 * - cntrl:     getType(c)==CONTROL
 * - graph:     hasBinaryProperty(c, UProperty.POSIX_GRAPH)
 * - print:     hasBinaryProperty(c, UProperty.POSIX_PRINT)}</pre>
 * <p>
 * The C/POSIX character classes are also available in UnicodeSet patterns,
 * using patterns like [:graph:] or \p{graph}.
 *
 * <p>{@icunote} There are several ICU (and Java) whitespace functions.
 * Comparison:<ul>
 * <li> isUWhiteSpace=UCHAR_WHITE_SPACE: Unicode White_Space property;
 *       most of general categories "Z" (separators) + most whitespace ISO controls
 *       (including no-break spaces, but excluding IS1..IS4 and ZWSP)
 * <li> isWhitespace: Java isWhitespace; Z + whitespace ISO controls but excluding no-break spaces
 * <li> isSpaceChar: just Z (including no-break spaces)</ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * This class is not subclassable.

--type:android.icu.util.IslamicCalendar
/**
 * <code>IslamicCalendar</code> is a subclass of <code>Calendar</code>
 * that that implements the Islamic civil and religious calendars.  It
 * is used as the civil calendar in most of the Arab world and the
 * liturgical calendar of the Islamic faith worldwide.  This calendar
 * is also known as the "Hijri" calendar, since it starts at the time
 * of Mohammed's emigration (or "hijra") to Medinah on Thursday, 
 * July 15, 622 AD (Julian).
 * <p>
 * The Islamic calendar is strictly lunar, and thus an Islamic year of twelve
 * lunar months does not correspond to the solar year used by most other
 * calendar systems, including the Gregorian.  An Islamic year is, on average,
 * about 354 days long, so each successive Islamic year starts about 11 days
 * earlier in the corresponding Gregorian year.
 * <p>
 * Each month of the calendar starts when the new moon's crescent is visible
 * at sunset.  However, in order to keep the time fields in this class
 * synchronized with those of the other calendars and with local clock time,
 * we treat days and months as beginning at midnight,
 * roughly 6 hours after the corresponding sunset.
 * <p>
 * There are three main variants of the Islamic calendar in existence.  The first
 * is the <em>civil</em> calendar, which uses a fixed cycle of alternating 29-
 * and 30-day months, with a leap day added to the last month of 11 out of
 * every 30 years.  This calendar is easily calculated and thus predictable in
 * advance, so it is used as the civil calendar in a number of Arab countries.
 * This is the default behavior of a newly-created <code>IslamicCalendar</code>
 * object.
 * <p>
 * The Islamic <em>religious</em> calendar and Saudi Arabia's <em>Umm al-Qura</em> 
 * calendar, however, are based on the <em>observation</em> of the crescent moon.  
 * It is thus affected by the position at which the
 * observations are made, seasonal variations in the time of sunset, the
 * eccentricities of the moon's orbit, and even the weather at the observation
 * site.  This makes it impossible to calculate in advance, and it causes the
 * start of a month in the religious calendar to differ from the civil calendar
 * by up to three days.
 * <p>
 * Using astronomical calculations for the position of the sun and moon, the
 * moon's illumination, and other factors, it is possible to determine the start
 * of a lunar month with a fairly high degree of certainty.  However, these
 * calculations are extremely complicated and thus slow, so most algorithms,
 * including the one used here, are only approximations of the true astronomical
 * calculations.  At present, the approximations used in this class are fairly
 * simplistic; they will be improved in later versions of the code.
 * <p>
 * Like the Islamic religious calendar, <em>Umm al-Qura</em> is also based 
 * on the sighting method of the crescent moon but is standardized by Saudi Arabia.
 * <p>  
 * The fixed-cycle <em>civil</em> calendar is used.
 * <p>
 * This class should not be subclassed.</p>
 * <p>
 * IslamicCalendar usually should be instantiated using 
 * {@link com.ibm.icu.util.Calendar#getInstance(ULocale)} passing in a <code>ULocale</code>
 * with the tag <code>"@calendar=islamic"</code> or <code>"@calendar=islamic-civil"</code> 
 * or <code>"@calendar=islamic-umalqura"</code>.</p>

/**

 *
 * <p><code>TimeZone</code> represents a time zone offset, and also computes daylight
 * savings.
 *
 * <p>Typically, you get a <code>TimeZone</code> using {@link #getDefault()}
 * which creates a <code>TimeZone</code> based on the time zone where the program
 * is running. For example, for a program running in Japan, <code>getDefault</code>
 * creates a <code>TimeZone</code> object based on Japanese Standard Time.
 *
 * <p>You can also get a <code>TimeZone</code> using {@link #getTimeZone(String)}
 * along with a time zone ID. For instance, the time zone ID for the
 * U.S. Pacific Time zone is "America/Los_Angeles". So, you can get a
 * U.S. Pacific Time <code>TimeZone</code> object with:
 *
 * <blockquote>
 * <pre>
 * TimeZone tz = TimeZone.getTimeZone("America/Los_Angeles");
 * </pre>
 * </blockquote>
 * You can use the {@link #getAvailableIDs()} method to iterate through
 * all the supported time zone IDs, or getCanonicalID method to check
 * if a time zone ID is supported or not. You can then choose a
 * supported ID to get a <code>TimeZone</code>.
 * If the time zone you want is not represented by one of the
 * supported IDs, then you can create a custom time zone ID with
 * the following syntax:
 *
 * <blockquote>
 * <pre>
 * GMT[+|-]hh[[:]mm]
 * </pre>
 * </blockquote>
 *
 * For example, you might specify GMT+14:00 as a custom
 * time zone ID.  The <code>TimeZone</code> that is returned
 * when you specify a custom time zone ID uses the specified
 * offset from GMT(=UTC) and does not observe daylight saving
 * time. For example, you might specify GMT+14:00 as a custom
 * time zone ID to create a TimeZone representing 14 hours ahead
 * of GMT (with no daylight saving time). In addition, 
 * <code>getCanonicalID</code> can also be used to
 * normalize a custom time zone ID.
 *
 * <p>For compatibility with JDK 1.1.x, some other three-letter time zone IDs
 * (such as "PST", "CTT", "AST") are also supported. However, <strong>their
 * use is deprecated</strong> because the same abbreviation is often used
 * for multiple time zones (for example, "CST" could be U.S. "Central Standard
 * Time" and "China Standard Time"), and the Java platform can then only
 * recognize one of them.

--type:android.icu.util.ULocale
/**
 * {@icuenhanced java.util.Locale}.{@icu _usage_}
 *
 * A class analogous to {@link java.util.Locale} that provides additional
 * support for ICU protocol.  In ICU 3.0 this class is enhanced to support
 * RFC 3066 language identifiers.
 *
 * <p>Many classes and services in ICU follow a factory idiom, in
 * which a factory method or object responds to a client request with
 * an object.  The request includes a locale (the <i>requested</i>
 * locale), and the returned object is constructed using data for that
 * locale.  The system may lack data for the requested locale, in
 * which case the locale fallback mechanism will be invoked until a
 * populated locale is found (the <i>valid</i> locale).  Furthermore,
 * even when a populated locale is found (the <i>valid</i> locale),
 * further fallback may be required to reach a locale containing the
 * specific data required by the service (the <i>actual</i> locale).
 *
 * <p>ULocale performs <b>'normalization'</b> and <b>'canonicalization'</b> of locale ids.
 * Normalization 'cleans up' ICU locale ids as follows:
 * <ul>
 * <li>language, script, country, variant, and keywords are properly cased<br>
 * (lower, title, upper, upper, and lower case respectively)</li>
 * <li>hyphens used as separators are converted to underscores</li>
 * <li>three-letter language and country ids are converted to two-letter
 * equivalents where available</li>
 * <li>surrounding spaces are removed from keywords and values</li>
 * <li>if there are multiple keywords, they are put in sorted order</li>
 * </ul>
 * Canonicalization additionally performs the following:
 * <ul>
 * <li>POSIX ids are converted to ICU format IDs</li>
 * <li>'grandfathered' 3066 ids are converted to ICU standard form</li>
 * <li>'PREEURO' and 'EURO' variants are converted to currency keyword form,
 * with the currency
 * id appropriate to the country of the locale (for PREEURO) or EUR (for EURO).
 * </ul>
 * All ULocale constructors automatically normalize the locale id.  To handle
 * POSIX ids, <code>canonicalize</code> can be called to convert the id
 * to canonical form, or the <code>canonicalInstance</code> factory method
 * can be called.
 *
 * <p>Note: The <i>actual</i> locale is returned correctly, but the <i>valid</i>
 * locale is not, in most cases.
